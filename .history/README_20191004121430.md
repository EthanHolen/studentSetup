## Software
### Mac OS

#### Editors
  ##### [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - VSCode is hands down one of my favorite editors for writing almost anything!
  ![](images/VSCode.png)

  - It has a dead simple, and beautiful UI which makes it easy to add and customize to your heart's content.  
  - I'm currently using [this](http://citylights.xyz) theme.

  ##### [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org)
  - Unfortunately, as a University Student, I'm required to use Eclipse as my java editor (If you know how to make it look less ugly please let me know im trying my best here).

  - If you're being forced to use this atrocity as well, here's a few tips to help ease the pain.
    1. Go into the settings and change the color immediately! The dark mode isn't good but its worlds better than the default!
    2. For those of you that know emacs keys this editor will slowly kill you unless you go into Preferences>General>keys and switch the scheme from Default to Emacs. 
    3. Command + shift + L opens keybindings which you can customize to your heart's content which I would highly recommend! (Ctrl + space will give you auto complete BTW)

##### Keyboard

* Currently im using the [Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com) and absolutley loving it. 
* After a considerable amount of typing on the [Poker3]() over the summer I developed some significant pain in my forearm, I think this had more to do with my overuse and setup of the keyboard than the keyboard itself though and would still highly reccommend the poker to anyone looking at it!
* As a PSA this keyboard takes a little while to get used to, as it is both split, and Ortholinear (meaning that the keys are straight up and down instead of staggered like a normal keyboard). Though I personally think the combination of the more comfortable hand position and the [programmability]() of this keyboard more than make up for the steep learning curve.

##### Mouse

* In the spirit of switching fully to an ergonomic setup I also switched out my previous mouse the [MX Master]() for its more ergonomic brother, the [MX Vertical]().
* Ive liked this mouse quite a bit since switching and was suprised to find that there was almost no adjustment period for the
